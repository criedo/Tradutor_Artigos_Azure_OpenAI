Talking to the Moon

I know you're somewhere out there, somewhere far away
I want you back, I want you back
My neighbors think I'm crazy, but they don't understand
You're all I had, you're all I had
At night when the stars light up my room
I sit alone
Talking to the moon
Trying to reach you
Hoping you're on the other side talking to me too
Or am I a fool who sits alone talking to the moon?
Oh
I'm feeling like I'm famous, the talk of the town
They say I've gone crazy, yes I've gone crazy
But they don't know what I know, because when the sun goes down
Someone's responding, yes, they're responding, oh
At night when the stars light up my room
I sit alone
Talking to the moon
Trying to reach you
Hoping you're on the other side talking to me too
Or am I a fool who sits alone talking to the moon?
Oh, oh, oh
Have you heard me calling?
(Ah) oh-oh-oh (ah), oh-oh-oh (ah)
'Cause every night I'm talking to the moon
Still trying to get to you
Hoping you're on the other side talking to me too
Or am I a fool who sits alone talking to the moon?
Oh
I know you're somewhere out there, somewhere far away
